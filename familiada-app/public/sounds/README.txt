Sound Effects for Familiada

This directory should contain the following sound effect files:
1. reveal.mp3 - Sound played when an answer is revealed
2. strike.mp3 - Sound played when a strike is added

You can replace these with actual sound files of your choice.
For example, you can find free sound effects at:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
- https://www.zapsplat.com/

Make sure to keep the filenames the same as referenced in the code.
